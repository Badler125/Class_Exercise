## Introduction

* My name is Benny, I am a college student trying to break into the world of FinTech.

* As of now my career goals are not quite set in stone but what I do know is that FinTech will be a big part of our future and that it is a field that I would love to work in.

* I chose FinTech as a career path because it is something that I find interesting and since FinTech is a rapidly growing industry there will surely be a growing demand for professionals in that field.
